                <p> <b> Snow</b> comprises individual ice crystals that grow while suspended in the atmosphere—usually
                    within clouds—and then fall,
                    accumulating on the ground where they undergo further changes.
                    [2] It consists of frozen crystalline water throughout its
                    life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere,
                    increase to millimeter size,
                    precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or
                    sublimate away.</p>

                <p>Snow develops in clouds that themselves are part of a larger weather system.
                    The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that
                    include moisture content and temperatures.
                    The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic
                    shapes and combinations thereof.
                    Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with
                    a very cold temperature inversion present.[4]</p>

    <h2>How to make snow:</h2>
    <ul>
        
        <li>Step 1
            <ol>
                <p>
                    Check the weather conditions to see if the water will freeze. Boiling water will only freeze
                    instantly if it is colder than −30 °F (−34 °C). Look up the weather on your local news station or by
                    searching online. Keep in mind that exposure to temperatures this low can be dangerous and you'll
                    need to wear a thick coat, pants, and a hat to protect yourself.[1]</p>

            </ol>
        </li>
        
        <li>Step 2
            <ol>
                <p>Boil a pot of tap water on the stovetop. You will need to be able to toss the water in the air, so
                    don't use more than 2 litres (0.53 US gal) of water. Pour your water into a pot and heat it on your
                    stovetop at the highest temperature. Wait a few minutes for the water to boil.[2]</p>
            </ol>
        </li>
        
        <li>Step 3
            <ol>
                <p>Hold the pot in both hands with oven mitts and carry it outside. You may want to enlist a friend or
                    parent to open the door for you so that you can get outside quickly. If the water stops boiling
                    before you get outside, this may not work. Be sure to walk carefully with the boiling pot as it is
                    going to be incredibly hot and you don't want to spill.[3]
                    Hold the handle of the pot with two hands. This will help you steady the pot as you walk and will
                    prevent dangerous spills.</p>
            </ol>
        </li>
       
        <li>Step 4
            <ol>
                <p>Toss your pot of water into the air to create instant snow. Let your arms down a little, then toss
                    the pot upwards and away from you while still holding on to it. You do not want the water coming
                    back to hit you, so be careful about doing this when it's windy. If the temperature is cold enough
                    and the water is still boiling, you will see the water turn into snow in mid-air.[4]X

        <li> <b> Step 5</b>
            <ol>
                <p>
                    Make a snowball if you can create enough snow. The snow that you create this way is real snow! You
                    won't generate much snow with your boiling water, but it is a neat trick and you may even be able to
                    scoop together a small snowball.</p>
